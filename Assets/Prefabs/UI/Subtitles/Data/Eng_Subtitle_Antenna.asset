  subtitle:
  - "This is an artist\u2019s representation of what one of the SKA-low frequency
    antennas might look like."
  - SKA-low will be made up of over 100,000 of these, broken up into stations of 256
    antennas each.
  - When the signal from each of these antennas is joined together using powerful
    supercomputers,
  - it will allow us to search the Universe with radio-eyes at a resolution never
    before possible.
