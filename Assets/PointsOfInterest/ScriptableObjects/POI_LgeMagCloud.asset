  Name: Large Magellanic Cloud
  ShortDescription: "The Large Magellanic Cloud is classified as a Magellanic spiral.
    \nIt contains a stellar bar that is geometrically off-center, suggesting that
    it was a barred dwarf spiral galaxy before its spiral arms were disrupted, likely
    by tidal interactions from the Small Magellanic Cloud, and the Milky Way's gravity."
  Distance: Approx. 163,000 light-years
