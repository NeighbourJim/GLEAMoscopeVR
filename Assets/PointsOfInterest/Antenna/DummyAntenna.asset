  ShortDescription: "This is an artist\u2019s representation of what one of the SKA-low
    frequency antennas might look like. SKA-low will be made up of over 100,000 of
    these, broken up into stations of 256 antennas each. When the signal from each
    of these antennas is joined together using powerful supercomputers, it will allow
    us to search the Universe with radio-eyes at a resolution never before possible.
    \r\n\r\nYou can change the wavelength your eyes can see, allowing you to see the
    Universe like never before. "
