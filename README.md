# GLEAMoscopeVR
An Educational VR Android application for Google Cardboard.
Created for [ICRAR](https://www.icrar.org/) and developed by myself and other students as part of my Diploma of Software Development.

## Motivation
The project was conceived after ICRAR wanted a proof of concept application to demonstrate the uses of Virtual Reality for education and outreach.

## Features
GLEAMoscopeVR allows the user to experience an immersive outback environment and view the night sky in a variety of wavelengths of energy (Gamma, X-Ray, Visible, Infrared, Microwave, and Radio).
There are also points of interest in the sky when viewing the Visible and Radio wavelengths which when interacted with will provide information about interstellar objects.

## Installation
